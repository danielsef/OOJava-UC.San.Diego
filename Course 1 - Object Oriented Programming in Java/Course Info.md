# Course 1 - Object Oriented Programming in Java

## Welcome and Project Overview: Visualizing Data
* Motivate the use of classes and objects in programming
* Create objects and call methods on them
* Describe member variables, methods and constructors
* Explain how to overload methods in Java and why overloading methods is useful
* Describe the meaning of the keywords public and private and their effect on where variables can be accessed

## Memory Models, Scope, and Starting the Project
* Select and effectively use Java documentation
* Generate visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries
* Create and draw memory models for reasoning about variable values for primitive and object data types
* Apply the basic rules for variable scope and explain how it impacts your code
* Practice tracing code using memory models and Java's rules for variable scope

## Graphical output: Creating GUIs and Displaying Data
* Create and manipulate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
* Find and effectively use Java documentation
* Use the Processing library in your programs
* Customize visual maps using Java code
* Use Java to read and parse data files
* Organize data into appropriate objects
* Describe and use the List data type and the ArrayList class
* Describe and use the Map data type 

## Inheritance
* Explain the value of inheritance as a feature in object oriented programming languages
* Use the keyword extends
* Explain the relationship between a superclass and a subclass
* Use UML Diagrams to display class hierarchies
* Explain an “is-a” relationship between classes
* Describe how Java object construction occurs from the inside out
* Use same-class and superclass constructors in class creation
* Create methods which override from a superclass
* Contrast method overloading and method overriding
* Explain the purpose of polymorphism
* Step through decisions made at compile time and runtime
* Use casting of objects to aid the compiler
* Use the keyword "abstract"
* Compare and contrast “inheritance of implementation” and “inheritance of interface”
* Decide between Abstract Classes and Interfaces 

## GUIs: Responding to User Events
* Distinguish between procedural programming and event-driven programming.
* Trace event-driven code
* Explain how mouse-clicks and keyboard input interact with the program execution
* Design user-interface elements
* Write code to implement a button and respond to mouse events
* Describe inheritance relationships used in the course so far
* Distinguish between interfaces and classes in this hierarchy 

## Searching and Sorting: From Code to Algorithms
* Motivate the importance of search
* Write code to perform a linear search
* Explain and implement the binary search algorithm
* Explain why binary search is better than linear search
* Define sorting
* Explain why sorting data can be useful
* Explain and implement the selection sort algorithm
* Trace code and describe its high-level function
* Describe alternate algorithms for sorting
* Use pre-defined Java methods to sort
* Explain the properties of this built-in sort algorithm
* Define and use the Comparable interface in Java
