Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond - UC San Diego - Coursera

This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with.
