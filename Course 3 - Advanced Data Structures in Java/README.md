# Course 3 - Advanced Data Structures in Java

## Introduction to the course and graphs
* Explain when the Graph abstract data type (ADT) is useful
* Compare the Graph ADT with other ADTs
* Define basic notions associated with graphs
* Write classes in Java to implement graphs
* Implement graphs in Java using an adjacency matrix representation and an adjacency list representation
* Describe advantages and disadvantages of adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations.
* Implement a method to find the neighbors of a vertex in two ways.
* Evaluate the performance of this method based on the representation.

## Class design and simple graph search
* Describe how a 2D maze problem can be represented as a graph
* Represent a geographic map as a graph
* Perform Depth-first Search (DFS) and Breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph
* Implement the code for DFS and BFS
* Analyze and compare the worst-case running time of DFS and BFS
* Describe how the ADTs Stack and Queue work
* Describe how Stacks are used in DFS and how Queues are used in BFS
* Design classes to represent a grid-based graph
* Explain the concepts of redesign and refactoring
* Critique aspects of code design
* Redesign and refactor code for better design

## Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs
