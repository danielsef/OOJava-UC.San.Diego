# Course 2 - Data Structures and Performance

## Introduction to the Course
* Describe the difference between an abstract data type (ADT) and its implementation.
* Work with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: String, LinkedList, TreeSet, HashSet, and HashMap.
* Implement fundamental data structures from scratch including Linked Lists and Tries (yes, we mean Tries rather than trees ... stay tuned to learn about this data structure!).
* Analyze the performance of code, using Big-O notation as well as through benchmarking experiments.
* Compare and contrast the performance of different data structures to select the most appropriate for a task.
* Write JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
* Implement several algorithms for generating and processing text.

## Working with Strings
* Describe how the Flesch Readability Score can be used to determine the readability of text
* Describe how Strings are represented in Java
* Perform basic operations with Strings in Java
* Work with the String class's built-in methods to manipulate Strings
* Write regular expressions to match String patterns
* Use regular expressions to split strings

## Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking
## Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness
## Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)
##  Hash Maps and Edit Distance
