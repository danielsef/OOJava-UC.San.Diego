# Course 1 - Object Oriented Programming in Java

## Welcome and Project Overview: Visualizing Data
* Motivate the use of classes and objects in programming
* Create objects and call methods on them
* Describe member variables, methods and constructors
* Explain how to overload methods in Java and why overloading methods is useful
* Describe the meaning of the keywords public and private and their effect on where variables can be accessed

## Memory Models, Scope, and Starting the Project
* Select and effectively use Java documentation
* Generate visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries
* Create and draw memory models for reasoning about variable values for primitive and object data types
* Apply the basic rules for variable scope and explain how it impacts your code
* Practice tracing code using memory models and Java's rules for variable scope
